title: Generate a Vector Map
---

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

Once you have produced a map, you might want to vectorize the pointcloud to get a vector map. This is a map with lines that represent the original map.

Once you have run nautilus and have a map that you are satisfied with, like from the [tutorial here](run_nautilus.mdx) than you can click the vectorize button on the RViz toolbar. This will begin vectorization (**please only click the button once until it is done for right now, thanks**). Eventually the output will be broadcast to the visualizer and it will look something like this:

<img alt="Vector Map" src={useBaseUrl('img/VectorizationFinished.png')}/>


### Capturing in a Bag

But, you may also want to capture this output. To capture the outputted vector map in a bag file use the following command in another terminal window or tab.

```
rosbag record /debug_lines
```

Then after the vector map shows up in RViz you can kill the rosbag record command with Ctrl-C.

### Capturing in a text file

You can also output to a text file the endpoints of every line. To do this set the following parameter in your config file that you are using:

```
map_output_file="<path_to_file_to_write>"
```
