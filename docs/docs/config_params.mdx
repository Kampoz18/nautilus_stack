### General

#### bag_path
Type: String

The path from the root of the project to the ROS bag file to be processed.


#### pose_number
Type: Integer

The number of lidar scans (and poses) to load from the bag file.

#### odom_topic
Type: String

The topic to pull odometry data from, this topic should have the ```nav_msgs/Odometry``` data type, or if differential_odom is set to true, it can be of type ```CobotMsgs/CobotOdometry```.

#### lidar_topic
Type: String

The topic to pull LiDAR data from, this topic should have the ```sensor_msgs/LaserScan``` type.

#### differential_odom
Type: Boolean

True if using CobotOdometry message, false otherwise.

#### pose_output_file
Type: String

The path to the file to output the pose positions too, this writing will be triggered when the user hits the WriteButton in RViz.

#### map_output_file
Type: String

The path to output the text file to output the vector map to. If unset then when the user hits the Vectorize Button in RViz there will be no text output.

### Performance

#### translation_weight
Type: Double

The multiplier applied to the translation error when optimizing the pose-graph.

#### rotation_weight
Type: Double

The multiplier applied to the rotation error when optimizing the pose-graph.

#### stopping_accuracy
Type: Double

When the scans change by less than this amount (in meters), the optimization iteration is deemed solved.

#### max_lidar_range
Type: Double

The maximum distance LiDAR data is allowed to be from the robot.

#### rotation_change_for_lidar
Type: Double

The amount of rotation needed to signal a lidar scan capture (in radians).

#### translation_change_for_lidar
Type: Double

The amount of translation needed to signal a lidar scan capture.

#### lidar_constraint_amount
Type: Integer

The number of poses to compare each pose too. For example the default is 10, therefore we compare and try to minimize error between the current pose and the past ten, for every pose.

#### outlier_threshold
Type: Double

Points further than this distance (in meters) cannot be counted as the same point during ICL/ICP in the optimization phase.

### Human-In-The-Loop

#### hitl_lc_topic
Type: String

The topic that HITL Slam tool send the message to trigger HITL Slam, **probably best to not change unless you know what you are doing**.

#### hitl_line_width
Type: Double

Points further than this will not count as falling on the HITL LC line and therefore will not be used for HITLSlam.

#### hitl_pose_point_threshold
Type: Integer

The amount of points needed to include a pose for HITL Slam.

### Autonomous Loop Closure

#### auto_lc
Type: Boolean

Automatically loop close or not

#### keyframe_chi_squared_test
Type: Boolean

Whether or not to use chi_squared test for keyframes

#### keyframe_min_odom_distance
Type: Double

Distance between keyframes if chi^2 is not in use

#### keyframe_local_uncertainty_filtering
Type: Boolean

Whether or not to use local uncertainty filtering for keyframes

#### local_uncertainty_condition_threshold
Type: Double

All scans with local uncertainty less than this threshold are one step closer to being used for automatic lc, if keyframe_local_uncertainty_filtering is on

#### local_uncertainty_scale_threshold
Type: Double

All scans with local uncertainty scale less than this threshold are one step closer to being used for automatic lc, if keyframe_local_uncertainty_filtering is on

#### local_uncertainty_prev_scans
Type: Integer

The amount of previous scans to use for calculating local uncertainty  if keyframe_local_uncertainty_filter    ing is on

#### lc_match_threshold
Type: Double

Threshold used in automatic loop closure.

#### lc_base_max_range
Type: Double

Base max range to consider a loop closure

#### lc_max_range_scaling
Type: Double

How much max range to consider a loop closure increases as nodes get more distant

#### lc_translation_weight
Type: Integer

Loop closure translation multiplier, used during loop closure for odometry residuals.

#### lc_rotation_weight
Type: Double

Loop closure rotation multiplier, used during loop closure for odometry residuals.

#### lc_min_keyframes
Type: Integer

Minimum number of keyframes that must exist between loop closures.

#### lc_debug_output_dir
Type: String

Used to dump images from auto-lc

### Normal Computation

#### nc_neighborhood_size
Type: Double

The neighborhood size to consider when RANSACing for normals.

#### nc_neighborhood_step_size
Type: Double

How much the neighborhood increases with each iteration.


#### nc_mean_distance
Type: Double

You got me, this one's just a constant.

#### nc_bin_number
Type: Integer

The number of buckets to use in the Hough transform.
